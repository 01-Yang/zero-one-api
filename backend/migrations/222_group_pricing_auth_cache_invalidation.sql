-- Group long-context and per-model pricing are part of the API-key auth
-- snapshot used by billing. Extend the latest durable invalidation trigger so
-- direct SQL edits and crashes between a group write and application-level
-- invalidation cannot leave stale pricing in L1/L2 caches. Based on migration
-- 193; never rewrite already-applied migrations.
